# Introduction to Functions as a Service


## Introduction to Function as a Service (FaaS)

Before we dive into Function as a Service (FaaS), let's see what the journey has been before FaaS: Physical Servers > Virtual Machines > Containers > Functions. 

Earlier, Physical Servers were used to run applications. Though they offered good performance, they were meant to support the working of specific applications only. If another application were to run on them, it would affect the workflows of both. The rise of Virtual Machines in 2001 allows enabling application-specific resources from physical machines to VM instances. This decreased the infrastructure concerns related to particular applications on physical servers. Then Docker containers came, which provided a lightweight alternative to Virtual machines by encapsulating only the application and it is specific dependencies inside a container. 

Functions make the developer's process even more autonomous. 
Functions are code snippets inside the container. 
Execute them based on some events. 

For example, a function can be made which creates a database, and on creation, it populates that database with values. Without functions, developers would have to wait for database creation and then manually update the database.

## Other Cloud Models you saw in this subject

Apart from FaaS, we have other cloud models:

- PaaS: Platform as a Service

PaaS provides a software development environment to clients by providing all software tools to developers in one place in an organized manner.

- SaaS: Software as a Service
 
Here the provider does not expose Virtual machines or networks to the user; instead provides him with access to software services such as databases. So the client doesn't need to worry about the OS and focuses on software.

- IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service

Here the client is provided by full infrastructure such as networks, Virtual machines, etc. In other terms, it is called " Cloud Computing ."

## What is Function as a Service (FaaS)?

Function as a Service is a cloud service execution model and uses functions for the purpose. As stated above, Function is a piece of code of business logic, more particularly, which is event-driven. That means that it gets triggered and performs its part on a launch of a particular event until the task is done. Functions can be of various types such as :

- Function to process a web request
- Function for any scheduled job
- A function that executes manually.

Moreover, we can also chain functions, which means a particular function on completion can trigger another function to execute. For example, A function for web requests on completion can trigger any scheduled job function. This way, the process becomes more autonomous.

List of Function as a Service (FaaS) Service providers on Public Clouds:

- Microsoft Azure
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Cloud Functions
- IBM functions
- Algoritmia
- ...

Below is a sample example of an Azure function snippet. 

```
Using System.Net; 
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, TraceWriter log) {     
  log.Info("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");     
  // Get request body     
  dynamic data = await req.Content.ReadAsAsync<object>();     
  return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, "Hello " + data.name);
 }
 ```
 

## How does Function as a Service Work?
Anyone who wants to get the benefits of FaaS needs to use a cloud service provider to implement FaaS.

- In the FaaS model, developers are not concerned with infrastructure and service-related computing, and they are only concerned with writing functions.
- These functions on getting invoked will cause the cloud provider to bring up the server, and on the successful execution of the Function, the server goes down.
- These servers get available on demand when the Function invokes and goes down until the Function executes. Thus saving cost for the subscriber of cloud services as well.


## What is the Serverless Architecture of FaaS?
Serverless architecture is a far broader concept than FaaS. With a large number of workloads now shifting to the cloud, cloud providers need to provide backend services like

- Load balancer configuration
- Cluster management
- Operating system to support the workloads etc

These are known as BaaS (Backend as a service). And serverless architecture comprises FaaS and BaaS. For example, in databases, many BaaS solution providers provide data validation mechanisms so an application can use these at its backend to authenticate with the database. Now FaaS comes into play. Consider the case when a new record is inserted into the database. Using FaaS, a small function can be added inside the application container, triggered when a new record is added inside the database. The serverless architecture makes FaaS more reliable and affordable. It promotes the trend to implement things as services and use API gateways to map HTTP requests with those functions.

### Code samples

You can generate new functions using the `faas-cli` and built-in templates or use any binary for Windows or Linux in a container.

Official templates exist for many popular languages and are easily extensible with Dockerfiles.

* Node.js (`node12`) example:

    ```js
   "use strict"

    module.exports = async (event, context) => {
        return context
            .status(200)
            .headers({"Content-Type": "text/html"})
            .succeed(`
            <h1>
                üëã Hello World üåç
            </h1>`);
    }

    ```
    *handler.js*

* Python 3 example:

    ```python
    import requests

    def handle(req):
        r =  requests.get(req, timeout = 1)
        return "{} => {:d}".format(req, r.status_code)
    ```
    *handler.py*

* Golang example (`golang-http`)

    ```golang
    package function

    import (
        "log"

        "github.com/openfaas-incubator/go-function-sdk"
    )

    func Handle(req handler.Request) (handler.Response, error) {
        var err error

        return handler.Response{
            Body: []byte("Try us out today!"),
            Header: map[string][]string{
                "X-Served-By": []string{"openfaas.com"},
            },
        }, err
    }
    ```
